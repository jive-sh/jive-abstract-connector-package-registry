/**
 * The functions every package-registry connector exposes, in the module `packageRegistry`
 * (`src/component/packageRegistry.ts`), exactly as its generated `ComponentApi` must type them. An app holding
 * a registry connector, such as `@jive-sh/server`, calls them the same way whichever registry it is.
 *
 * Jive provisions a new package in three steps, the first two through this contract:
 * 1. `createPlaceholder`: the package comes into existence as an empty version published by a person's account.
 * 2. `registerTrustedPublisher`: the package's CI workflow is allowed to publish it.
 * 3. CI publishes every real version with its OIDC identity, outside this contract.
 *
 * Step 3 must follow step 2 promptly: npm expires a trusted-publisher configuration whose first publish has not
 * happened within 2 days; an expired one stays listed but "can no longer be used or edited", and the remedy is to
 * delete it and create a new one (https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers#trusted-publisher-configuration-expiry).
 * `listTrustedPublishers` says which publishers have published (`validated`) and `removeTrustedPublisher` deletes
 * one, so a caller can replace a publisher that never published.
 *
 * All five are actions, since each calls the registry over the network. Each type is written out without
 * intersections, the way Convex generates it, because the build compares the two for exact equality.
 *
 * A connector stores no credentials. A function that acts as an account is given that account's credentials by
 * its caller on every call (`account`), so one connector instance serves every person's account, and where
 * credentials live, and how they are refreshed, is the caller's decision.
